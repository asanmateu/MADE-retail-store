# MADE Architecture Patterns

I am building a furniture retailer software from scratch focusing on domain-driven design, test-driven development, and event-driven microservices. 

The foundations of this software's architecture while reading through **Architecture Patterns with Python Enabling Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design, and Event-Driven Microservices by Bob Gregory and Harry Percival**.

My goal is to upon the book's architecture and build a fully functional software that can be used by a furniture retailer with enhanced AI functionalities.
